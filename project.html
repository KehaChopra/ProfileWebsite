    <p style="font-size: 20px; padding:10px;">My journey into web development began when I challenged myself to recreate the Amazon homepage using just HTML and CSS. It was my first project, and through it, I learned how to structure webpages, create responsive layouts, and design clean user interfaces. That small beginning sparked a big interest — and since then, I’ve kept exploring and learning new skills.

Recently, I built and launched my own personal portfolio website, where I showcase my projects, achievements, and growth as a developer. I’m now diving deeper into the world of development by planning to learn JavaScript next, and gradually moving toward backend technologies. My goal is to become a Full Stack Developer — someone who can build complete web applications from start to finish.</p>

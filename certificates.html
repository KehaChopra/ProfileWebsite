    <p>I attended a hands-on app development workshop organized by Humble Coders, where I developed three beginner-friendly yet functional Android apps — a Coder Encoder, a Domino’s Meal Planner, and a Tweeting App — using Kotlin and Android Studio. This workshop gave me my first taste of real-world app development and helped me understand how ideas turn into working applications.</p>
    <p>During the workshop, I gained practical experience in:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Setting up and navigating Android Studio</li>
  <li>Writing clean and basic code using Kotlin</li>
  <li>Learned basics of Jetpack Compose</li>
</ul>

<p>The experience gave me a strong foundation in app development and motivated me to go further. I’m now enrolled in their full app development course, where I’m learning Android development in more depth. </p>

<p> Beyond academics, I am also an active team player. My team proudly secured a Gold Medal in cricket, reflecting my dedication, leadership, and collaboration skills on and off the field.This experience taught me the importance of strategy, collaboration, and staying focused under pressure — qualities I now bring into both my projects and personal goals.
